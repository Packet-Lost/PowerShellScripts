# PowerShellScripts

Various functions and scripts I have written.

# AWSFunctions

These are some functions that utilize AWS Tools for PowerShell cmdlets. Most often I need to map to instances by their Name tag since I deal with mostly persistent windows ec2 instaces and these functions help me do that. 

# ProfileFunctions

Functions I usually dot source into my powershell profile
